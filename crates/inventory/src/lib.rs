//! Inventory: warehouses and locations (including service vans), units of measure, lots, the
//! immutable stock move ledger with its balance projection, reservations for sales orders and
//! stock counts. Design: [ADR 0019](../../docs/adr/0019-inventory-stock-ledger.md).
//!
//! Other modules post stock changes with [`ledger::post_move`] in their own transaction; they
//! never write the inventory tables themselves.
